    Write a ternary that does the same thing as the age challenge
    Age Challenge (if else):
    let age = 30;
    if (age >= 25) {
        console.log("Yay! You can rent a car!");
    } else if (age >= 21) {
        console.log("Yay! You can drink!");
    } else if (age >= 18) {
        console.log("Yay! You can vote!");
    } else {
        console.log("Sorry, you're too young to do anything fun.");
    }
*/

let age = 19

age = (age>= 25) ? console.log('You can rent a car!') : (age >= 21) ? console.log('Yay! you can drink') : (age >= 21) ? console.log('Yay! you can drink'): console.log("Sorry you're too young to do anything");
