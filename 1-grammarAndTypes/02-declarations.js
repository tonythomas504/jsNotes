// let a = 2; 

//     let   b    =     1;
//*(1)   (2)   (3)  (4)

//* 1- Keyword letting javascript know that you're making  variable. Going to see "let" the most.
//* 2- Variable name- do something that makes sense
//* 3- Assignment Operator- letting the code know what the variable is going to be assigned
//* 4- Variable Value- whatever value your variable is going to be storing

// console.log(a + b);

// let c = 3;

// let hello = 'greet';
// let Hello = 'greet again';
// console.log(hello + Hello);

let hiThere = 'hey'

//* VAR LET CONST
// var x = 1;
// let y = 2;
// const z = 3; //! const is not changeable cannot reassign value to this variable

//* DECLARTIONS vs INITIALIZATION 
// let n; 
//* On the left hand side of a variable
// console.log(n);

n = 10;
//? Giving the varible a value is initializing it
// console.log(n);

//* LET vs CONST
let today = 'Great!';
const elevenFifty = 'Wonderful!';
console.log(today, elevenFifty);

today = 'Lovely!';
console.log(today, elevenFifty);

//* elevenFifty = 'Fantastic!'; Cannot reassign a const
console.log(today, elevenFifty);
