Job of the Client
Let's keep it simple for now. Just remember that a client has two major jobs:

1. Display data for the user. Render items to the DOM.
2. Make HTTP requests to the server. We'll talk about this next.

4 Commonly Used HTTP Verbs

POST
Any time a user is creating new information, that is usually a POST request. So, in the above example, when they make a write a new post and hit post.

GET
Any time a user is retrieving existing information, that is usually a GET request. So, in the above example, when a user goes to messenger and can see all their friends messages.

PUT
Any time a user is overwriting existing information or updating information, that is usually a PUT request. So, in the above example, when a user updates their favorite brands they are doing a PUT request.

DELETE
Any time a user is deleting existing information, that is usually a DELETE request. So, in the above example, when a user would delete their profile, they would be doing a DELETE request.

//* Endpoints are just a URL that the API developer decides, where clients can access specific information.

3 States of Promises 

1. Pending - You have to wait until December 25 to receive your gift and find out whether you are naughty or nice.
2. Resolved - You've been a good little boy/girl and get that super awesome toy from Santa that you asked for.
3. Rejected - That super awesome toy of your dreams isn't waiting under the tree. You've been a mischievous, disobedient little brat and get what you deserve: a lump of coal.
*/

//* Basic model of a fetch
/* 
1. The fetch() method takes in your desired resource's path as a mandatory argument.
2. The Request object returns a Promise that resolves to the argument's Response.
3. After retrieving a Response, a multitude of methods define the body content and how it will be handled.
4. Please note that you can use the Request() and Response() constructors to directly create requests and responses, but they are more likely to be created by other API actions.

*/

/* Basic Fetch Components 
GlobalFetch - contains the fetch() used to fetch a resource.

Headers - HTTP response/request headers can be queried and allow you to do things such as retrieving, updating, or deleting.

Request - a resource request. It contains the method of the request (GET, POST, etc.), the url, associated headers, and more.

Response - the response to the request. It contains the headers and url, but more importantly replies with the status code to determine whether or not the request was successful.

Body - contains methods relating to the main content of the response/request that allow you to specify content type and how to handle it.
